# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code. Read this at session start. Full session history is in `Dev/AI/Claude/MEMORY.md` (local only, not in git) — read it when older context matters.

## Running the App

```bash
python app/main.py          # runs on http://localhost:8006 in debug mode
```

Dependencies are managed via `app/pyproject.toml` with a virtual env at `.venv/`. Python 3.14+ required.


## Architecture

This is a **Plotly/Dash** web app (single file: `app/main.py`) for percussion/rhythm analysis. Deployed to Plotly cloud (URL in README.md).

### Two-layer design: Python server + JavaScript client

**`app/main.py`** handles:
- Dash layout and server-side callbacks
- Audio processing via `librosa` and `soundfile` (onset detection, waveform building)
- Load/save of recordings (JSON with embedded base64 WAV + metronome metadata)

**`app/assets/recorder.js`** handles:
- Microphone access (`MediaRecorder` API)
- Metronome playback via Web Audio API (with HTMLAudio fallback for Safari only — Chrome, including on Plotly cloud, uses the per-tone WebAudio fallback)
- Recording countdown delay (one measure count-in before capture begins)
- In-browser WAV encoding (`encodeWAV`) — recorded blobs are decoded and re-encoded as WAV before sending to Python

### How recorder.js is loaded

**Inlined into HTML** via `load_inline_script()`, not served as a normal Dash asset. `assets_ignore=r"recorder(?:_bundle)?\.js"` tells Dash to skip the file. Every JS change requires a **server restart**, not just browser refresh.

### JS → Python data flow

Dash hidden components act as a message bus:

1. Recording stops → JS encodes WAV → `window.recordedAudioData`
2. JS clicks hidden `#audio-process-btn`
3. `audio-data-store` clientside callback pushes data to Dash store
4. Python `process_audio` fires, runs librosa analysis → waveform figure + JSON blob → `audio-store`
5. Other callbacks read `audio-store` to update UI

Recording phase state (`idle` / `delay` / `recording`) synced through `#recording-phase-sync` hidden input via `setDashInputValue()` (fires React synthetic events).

### Audio processing

`librosa.beat.beat_track` intentionally disabled — crashes Plotly cloud worker (numba/llvmlite JIT). Uses `librosa.onset.onset_detect` instead.

Waveform pipeline: raw audio → `trim_audio_tail` → `normalize_waveform_for_display` → `smooth_waveform_for_display` → `downsample_waveform_preserve_peaks` → Plotly figure with metronome beat markers (red/orange diamonds) and detected pulse markers (green circles).

### Calibration and timing model

The app measures output latency to synchronise recording start with metronome beat 1. Because Web Audio's `outputLatency` API is unreliable on many systems, a **calibration recording** is used instead:

- Calibration plays one measure with `onlyLowTone=true` (speaker → mic) and measures `median(beat_times % seconds_per_beat)`, normalised to `(−spb/2, spb/2]` → `cal_s` (seconds).
- `cal_s` is saved in every recording's JSON as `calibration_offset_ms`.
- All analysis (deviation formulas, subdivision assignment, `metronome_times_display`) applies `t − cal_s` to correct for the recording-start offset.
- `cal_s` varies by system state: ~0ms when API reports latency accurately, ~−164ms when API under-reports (~0ms measured vs ~337ms actual), ~+161ms when API over-reports on cold browser startup. All values produce correct analysis because `cal_s` is measured and saved per session.

### Known timing quirks

- **Cold-browser first tone dropped:** On first audio use after OS restart, the hardware audio device takes 50–200ms to open. A 150ms silent primer buffer in `startMetronomePlayback → startScheduler` forces the device open before the first real tone fires. `firstToneDelaySeconds` is 150ms (not the original 20ms) for the same reason.
- **Dash double-fire:** `toggleMetronome` fires twice on click (async AudioContext resume → state sync → Dash callback chain). Handled by directional debounce: suppress Stop arriving within 2s of a Start.

## Last session -- 2026-05-20

**Play Exercise Tones + Play Only Exercise Tones + bug fixes (eaea291):**

- `exercises.py`: voicing_code tones now meaningful (B=low, l=mid, s=sub, .=none,
  h/t/F/x=high). Used by exercise tone playback routing.
- `audio_utils.py`: `compute_metronome_track` gains `play_tones`, `char_tone_map`,
  and `play_only_tones` params.
  - `play_tones=True`: plays voiced chars using char_tone_map; metro tones play on same
    beat only if no exercise char there.
  - `play_only_tones=True`: plays only voiced non-'.' chars; all metro/sub tones silent.
  - Bug 1 fix: sub ticks now play at ghost-note ('.') positions when play_subdivisions=True
    (removed erroneous `and char != '.'` guard).
- `main.py`: added "Play Exercise Tones" and "Play Only Exercise Tones" toggles (shown
  only when exercise is selected). Mutual exclusion: turning on either toggle turns off
  the other. Both wired into `update_metronome_track`.
- `recorder.js`: Bug 3 fix -- pendingStart redesign. `loadMetronomeTrack` and
  `reconfigureMetronome` no longer call `setMetronomeWarmingUpState(true)`.
  `toggleMetronome` start branch: if no buffer, sets `pendingStart=true` and shows
  enabled "Warming Up..." (clickable to cancel). `_decodeMetronomeTrack` success: if
  `pendingStart`, auto-starts instead of restoring button. `stopMetronomePlayback`
  clears `pendingStart`. Result: metronome can always be stopped; param changes while
  playing stop immediately without locking the button.

**Open:** (none)

## Debugging Approach

- Diagnose root cause before proposing fixes; avoid speculative patches like adding many path candidates or combining detectors without evidence.
- When a fix regresses other behavior (e.g., timing, alignment), stop and investigate state/side effects before iterating further.
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes over broad refactors when debugging.

## Audio/Rhythm App Conventions

- When changing sample rate or hop_length, update ALL librosa calls consistently: frames_to_time, onset_detect, n_fft scaling.
- Beat filtering should use the smoothed onset envelope, not instantaneous waveform values.
- Any shift/offset constant must be applied to both beat_times and the waveform display.
- Centralize defaults in the settings dict rather than hardcoding.

## Session Wrap-Up Behavior

- When the user says they want to wrap up, commit notes, or update memory files: do ONLY that. Do not start new exploration or investigation.
- Confirm scope before running additional Read/Bash/Grep commands at end of session.

## Tooling Preferences

- For Python venv/dependency issues, prefer running `uv venv` directly when requested rather than suggesting shell-level VIRTUAL_ENV workarounds.
- Respect IDE-native solutions (e.g., PyCharm interpreter settings) over global shell hacks.
